# Driverless_2022
Contains the preprocessing and END_TO_END driverless code for Open Source Vehicle.

This code helps in getting the steering angle, throttle and brake of self driving car. The inspiration is taken from [Udacity Self driving car](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3) module as well End to End Learning for [Self-Driving Cars](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) module from NVIDIA.

The End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars research paper can be found at (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316) This repository uses CNNs to predict steering angle, throttle and brake of the car according to the different roads.

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vkNr3CU1UBSjDHRybQZRwojt6bhdJUys/view?usp=sharing)<br/>

## Python Implementation
1. Network Used- Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
2. Keras-Tensorflow Architecture

### Procedure in Implementation 1
1. Download the dataset from the drive link and place it in the data folder.  
2. Run the [END TO END.ipynb](https://github.com/amf-it/Driverless_2022_batch/blob/main/END%20TO%20END.ipynb) notebook to train and test the model
3. Trained Model weights can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G35ssa4Sr5yR_GAJy1kiTSq797St_y92/view?usp=sharing).
